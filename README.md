# Speech To Text To Speech Translation

This project handles local real-time audio to audio translation over sockets with OpenAI's Whisper and Microsoft SpeechT5 TTS. The project includes a client and server Python program.

Within the client, the user can pipe in the audio output to any virtual microphone or audio device they would like. 

### Server Installation Instructions:
#### These are all important steps!

Ensure your ports specified in server.py is open! Otherwise your socket connection will fail.

Make sure your XCode CLI or C++ compiler tools are fully updated!
